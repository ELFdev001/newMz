This is the latest version of the software used in the Medieval Warfare on the Grid project. This project ran from 2007-2011 and was directed by three PIs: John Haldon, Vince Gaffney and Georgios Theodoropoulos.

The software and its results are described in the Archaeopress monograph 'Modelling the Logistics of Mantzikert', which is available here: https://www.archaeopress.com/Archaeopress/Products/9781803277998

This software generates an army of individual software agents and moves them over a landscape from a start point to an end point. It is used to examine such processes as crowding and the effects of organisation on army movement as a whole.

There are three pieces of software within this package: the ABM which calculates the movements of each of the individual agents, an Excel spreadsheet which analyses the aggregate data and two Python scripts which run in Blender to produce a visual representation of the movement.

There is a docx file containing the installation instructions and one containing usage instructions.

Please be advised that this software was created in order for its outputs to be used within the project and not as an accessible tools for others. As a result, it is not at all easy to use properly. If you would like to use this software, it might be best to get in touch with Phil Murgatroyd (P.Murgatroyd@bradford.ac.uk) first so I can help you.
